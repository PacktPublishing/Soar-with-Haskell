**The ultimate beginners’ guide to mastering functional programming from the ground up**

## What is this book about?
With software systems reaching new levels of complexity and programmers aiming for the highest productivity levels, software developers and language designers are turning toward functional programming because of its powerful and mature abstraction mechanisms. This book will help you tap into this approach with Haskell, the programming language that has been leading the way in pure functional programming for over three decades.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Write pure functions in all their forms – that is basic, recursive, and higher-order functions
* Model your data using algebraic datatypes
* Master Haskell’s powerful type-class mechanism for ad hoc overloading
* Find out how Haskell’s laziness gets the job done
* Reconcile Haskell’s functional purity with side effects
* Familiarize yourself with the functor, applicative functor, monad hierarchy
* Discover how to solve problems with domain-specific languages
* Find more bugs with Haskell’s property-based testing approach

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
redSuits :: [Suit]
redSuits = Hearts : Diamonds : []
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you are a programmer looking to gain knowledge of Haskell who’s never been properly introduced to functional programming, this book is for you. Basic experience with programming in a non-functional language is a prerequisite. This book also serves as an excellent guide for programmers with limited exposure to Haskell who want to deepen their understanding and foray further into the language.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-16).
### Software and Hardware List
| Chapter | Software required | OS required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 1-16 | Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) | Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (Any) |
